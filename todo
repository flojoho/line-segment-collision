do i really need the intersection point or only check if the segments intersect?

pre check for bounding box collision

> use bounding box overlap at the end to determine segment collision






line collision vs section collision
  own function for each?
  does it make sense to pass sections as an argument for checking line intersection? if not what else?
  one function that just checks collision and another one that also calculates intersection point?
